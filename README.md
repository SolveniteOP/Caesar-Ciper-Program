# Caesar Cipher Encryption/Decryption

This project is a simple Python program that implements the Caesar Cipher, a basic encryption technique where each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a fixed number of places down or up the alphabet. The program allows users to both encrypt and decrypt messages using this method.

## About the Project

The Caesar Cipher is one of the oldest known encryption techniques, named after Julius Caesar, who reportedly used it to communicate with his officials. This project demonstrates the fundamental principles of cryptography by providing a simple yet effective way to encrypt and decrypt messages using Python.

## How It Works

The Caesar Cipher works by shifting each letter in the message by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 3:

- `A` becomes `D`
- `B` becomes `E`
- `C` becomes `F`

When decrypting, the process is reversed.

### Features

- **Encrypt Messages**: Shift each letter in the plaintext by a user-defined number.
- **Decrypt Messages**: Reverse the shift to recover the original message.
- **Custom Shift Values**: The shift value can be set by the user.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/SolveniteOp/caesar-cipher.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd caesar-cipher
    ```

## Usage

1. Run the program:
    ```bash
    python3 caesar_cipher.py
    ```

2. Choose whether to encrypt or decrypt a message.

3. Enter the shift value.

4. Input your message.
